Hi! I'm a Ph.D Student in [IRiS Lab](http://iris.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jee-Hwan Ryu](http://iris.kaist.ac.kr/people/professor/). My research focuses on telerobotics and haptics, with a particular focus on designing transparent, stable, and intelligent systems for remote control. Recently, my studies have expanded to exploring remote control systems through simulation and developing Digital Twins to replicate remote environments in virtual spaces.

I received a M.Sc in Robotics from [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr/) and B.Sc in M.E and EE (Double Major) from [SungKyunKwan University](https://skku.edu)
